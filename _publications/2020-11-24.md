This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2021 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) (ISBI 2021) to be held virtually on April 13-16, 2021.
In this paper, we propose a new confidence map measurement algorithm for ultrasound images.  Our novel confidence algorithms analyze pixel values using a directed acyclic graph based on acoustic physical properties of ultrasound imaging. We demonstrate unique capabilities of our approach and compare it against previous confidence-measurement algorithms for shadow-detection and image-compounding tasks. My contribution is speckle noise denoising.
