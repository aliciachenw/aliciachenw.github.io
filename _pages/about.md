I am Wanwen Chen (陈婉雯), a first-year Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, and my advisor is Dr. [Tim Salcudean](https://ece.ubc.ca/tim-salcudean/). Currently, I am investigating the potential of 3D ultrasound in transoral robotic surgery, working closely with the Vancouver General Hospital. I am a recipient of the Four Years Doctoral Fellowship at the University of British Columbia.

Overall, my research lies at the intersection of medical images and robotics. My research interests include augmented reality for surgery, ultrasound-based diagnosis, and AI for medical image analysis. I believe computer-aided image analysis, visualization, and intervention can improve patient outcomes and ease the clinicians' load, and I hope my research has clinical values and can be transferred to the real world.

I have a M.S. in Robotics from the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Dr. [John Galeotti](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-galeotti/). Before joining CMU, I received a B.S. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I worked with Dr. [Qining Wang](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/subpaget.asp?id=239). I visited [Biomechatronics Lab](https://uclabiomechatronics.wordpress.com/) at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Dr. [Veronica J. Santos](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/veronica-santos/) for the Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology (CSST) in 2018. 

Outside research, I enjoy spending time in sports and outdoor. I like biking, hiking, hitting the gym, and hoping to master skiing during my stay in Canada. I as well have fun reading books, writing proses, listening to music, and using Duolingo. I still mail hand-written letters to friends occasionally and I like sending postcards especially when I am traveling.
