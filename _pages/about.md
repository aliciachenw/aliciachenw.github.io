I will be a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia starting in September 2021, and my advisor is Dr. [Tim Salcudean](https://ece.ubc.ca/tim-salcudean/). My research interests are ultrasound imaging and image guidance for robot-assisted surgery.

I received my M.S. degree in Robotics from the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I was advised by Dr. [John Galeotti](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-galeotti/), being a member of the [Biomedical Image Guidance Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/biomedical-image-guidance/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. I was advised by Dr. [Qining Wang](http://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891217.htm) from 2017 to 2019, and I visited [Biomechatronics Lab](https://uclabiomechatronics.wordpress.com/) at University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Dr. [Veronica J. Santos](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/veronica-santos/), for [the Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology (CSST)](https://csst.ucla.edu/)  program in 2018.
