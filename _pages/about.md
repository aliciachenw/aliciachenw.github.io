I am Wanwen Chen (陈婉雯), a  Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) at [Robotics and Control Lab](https://rcl.ece.ubc.ca/home-page/), the University of British Columbia, advised by Dr. [Tim Salcudean](https://ece.ubc.ca/tim-salcudean/). My research interests include augmented reality for surgery, ultrasound-based diagnosis, and self-supervised representation learning. I am investigating the potential of ultrasound in transoral robotic surgery, working closely with the Vancouver General Hospital.

I have a M.S. in Robotics from the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Dr. [John Galeotti](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-galeotti/). Before joining CMU, I received a B.S. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I worked with Dr. [Qining Wang](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/subpaget.asp?id=239). I visited [Biomechatronics Lab](https://uclabiomechatronics.wordpress.com/) at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Dr. [Veronica J. Santos](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/veronica-santos/) for the Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology (CSST) in 2018. 

Outside research, you can find me skiing, running, biking, hiking, and hitting the gym. I also enjoy good books and coffee.

<!-- **News:** I am organizing the [Data Curation and Augmentation in Medical Imaging Workshop at CVPR 2024](https://dca-in-mi.github.io/)! -->
