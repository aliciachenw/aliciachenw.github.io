I am Wanwen Chen (陈婉雯), a first-year Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, and my advisor is Dr. [Tim Salcudean](https://ece.ubc.ca/tim-salcudean/). My research interests are in image guidance for robot-assisted surgery, including developing computer vision algorithms for medical robotics and ultrasound diagnosis. Currently, I start investigating the potential of 3D ultrasound in transoral robotic surgery. I am a recipient of the Four Years Doctoral Fellowship at the University of British Columbia.

I hold a M.S. in Robotics from the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Dr. [John Galeotti](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-galeotti/) on ultrasound and medical robotics. Before joining CMU, I received a B.S. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I was advised by Dr. [Qining Wang](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/subpaget.asp?id=239) from 2017 to 2019. I visited [Biomechatronics Lab](https://uclabiomechatronics.wordpress.com/) at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Dr. [Veronica J. Santos](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/veronica-santos/) for the Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Science and Technology (CSST) in 2018.

Outside research, I like biking, hiking, reading, and writing.
