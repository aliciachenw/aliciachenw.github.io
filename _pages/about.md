Hi! I am Wanwen Chen (陈婉雯), a  Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, working in the [Robotics and Control Lab](https://rcl.ece.ubc.ca/home-page/) under the supervision of Dr. [Tim Salcudean](https://ece.ubc.ca/tim-salcudean/). I collaborate closely with the [Prisman Lab](https://www.prismanlab.ca/) at Vancouver General Hospital. I am also working at Prenuvo as a Machine Learning Intern.

My research focuses on developing advanced ultrasound and surgical augmented reality systems for transoral robotic surgery, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes through intelligent, image-guided interventions. I build deep learning pipelines for ultrasound, MRI, and CT, and translate these technologies into real-world surgical and robotic applications. With a strong background in interdisciplinary collaboration, I’m passionate about applying cutting-edge robotics and machine learning to healthcare challenges.

Previously, I earned a M.S. in Robotics from the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Dr. [John Galeotti](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-galeotti/). I earned a B.S. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I worked with Dr. [Qining Wang](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/subpaget.asp?id=239). I’ve had the opportunity to intern at Intuitive Surgical in 2023 and to visit [Biomechatronics Lab](https://uclabiomechatronics.wordpress.com/) at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Dr. [Veronica J. Santos](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/veronica-santos/) in 2018. 

Outside research, you can find me skiing, running, swimming, hiking, and hitting the gym. I also enjoy good books and coffee.
