**About Me**

* My native languages are Cantonese and Mandarin.
* I enjoy music and musicals. When I am working towards a deadline I like listening to *[Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical))*. But *[Mozart!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart!)* is the one I enjoy most. *[Come from Away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_from_Away)* is the most inspiring musical I listened to in 2020. My recent favorite singer is [milet(ミレイ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milet_(singer)). 
* I like jogging, reading, and writing letters to my pen friends in my spare time. I enjoy detective stories and crime stories most!
